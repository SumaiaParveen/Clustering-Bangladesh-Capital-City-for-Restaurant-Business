## [About the Project](https://github.com/SumaiaParveen/Clustering-Bangladesh-Capital-City-for-Restaurant-Business/blob/master/Part1_Introduction.ipynb)

The basis of this study is to help a small group of investors who want to open their first restaurant in the Dhaka division in Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh is a relatively small yet densely populated country, her socio-economic standard is only improving every year. Lifestyle is changing fast in major cities like Dhaka. People are more prone to buy ready-foods instead of spending time to prepare them at home. The business is already competitive; hence a strategic plan is required. We can phrase the business problem like this- “Where to Open Our First Restaurant in Dhaka, Bangladesh?”
