    "\n",
    "Bangladeshis are known to be great food enthusiasts for decades. Going out to dine with families and friends has become a part of people’s daily life. People are inclining to try out foods from different countries day by day. Food delivery services evolved dramatically over the last couple of years. The food review YouTube channels are viewed the most in Bangladesh. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, busy consumers don't have the opportunity or tendency to cook. They want the flavor of fresh food without the hassle of cooking. They want spicy, tasty, nutritious meals without dishes to wash. An increasing number of students, working parents, and elderly individuals prefer prominent convenience when it comes to purchasing their meals. The need for food-service businesses is increasing gradually with the improvement in the socio-economic condition of the country. Thus, it would be advantageous if we can predict the criteria that would help us to make a profit from a food-service business based in Bangladesh.\n",

    "### Business Problem \n",
    " \n",
    "The basis of this study is to help a small group of investors who want to open their first restaurant in the Dhaka division in Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh is a relatively small yet densely populated country, her socio-economic standard is only improving every year. Lifestyle is changing fast in major cities like Dhaka. People are more prone to buy ready-foods instead of spending time to prepare them at home. The business is already competitive; hence a strategic plan is required. We can phrase the business problem like this- **“Where to Open Our First Restaurant in Dhaka, Bangladesh?”**\n"
